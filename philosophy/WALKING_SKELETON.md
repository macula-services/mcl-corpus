# The Walking Skeleton — Fully Operational from Day 1

*Build the thinnest possible slice through all layers, deployed to all environments, before adding features.*

**A doctrine for the [Crafting process](alc/README.md)**

---

## The Principle

> **Don't build all the code, then add deployment.**
> **Build the deployment, then add the code.**

A Walking Skeleton is:
- The **thinnest possible end-to-end slice**
- Through **all architectural layers** (CMD → PRJ → QRY)
- Deployed to **all environments** (TEST → STAGING → PROD)
- With **full CI/CD operational**
- **Before** implementing business features

---

## Why Walking Skeleton?

### The Big Bang Anti-Pattern

```
❌ BIG BANG INTEGRATION

Week 1-4: Build all desks locally
Week 5:   "Now let's add CI/CD"
Week 6:   "Why doesn't it deploy?"
Week 7:   "GitOps is broken"
Week 8:   "Works on my machine..."
Week 9:   "Production is different"
Week 10:  Still debugging infrastructure
```

**Problems:**
- Integration issues discovered late
- Infrastructure assumptions invalidated
- Long feedback loops
- High risk at the end

### The Walking Skeleton Approach

```
✅ WALKING SKELETON

Day 1:  Scaffold + CI/CD + GitOps + initialize_* desk
Day 2:  Deploy to PROD (empty but operational)
Day 3+: Add desks one by one, each deploys immediately
```

**Benefits:**
- Integration issues discovered immediately
- Infrastructure validated early
- Short feedback loops
- Low risk throughout

## The Skeleton Components

### 1. Codebase Scaffold

Create the domain structure with empty departments:

```
apps/{domain}/
├── src/
│   ├── {domain}_app.erl
│   ├── {domain}_sup.erl
│   ├── {domain}_store.erl
│   │
│   └── initialize_{dossier}/    ← Skeleton desk
│       ├── initialize_{dossier}_desk_sup.erl
│       ├── initialize_{dossier}_v1.erl
│       ├── {dossier}_initialized_v1.erl
│       ├── maybe_initialize_{dossier}.erl
│       └── {dossier}_initialized_to_{table}.erl
│
└── rebar.config

apps/query_{domain}/
├── src/
│   ├── query_{domain}_app.erl
│   ├── query_{domain}_sup.erl
│   ├── query_{domain}_store.erl
│   │
│   └── find_{dossier}/
│       └── find_{dossier}.erl
│
└── rebar.config
```

---

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml or equivalent

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - package
  - deploy

build:
  - rebar3 compile
  - rebar3 dialyzer

test:
  - rebar3 eunit
  - rebar3 ct (if applicable)

package:
  - rebar3 release
  - docker build
  - docker push

deploy:
  - update GitOps repo
  - (reconciler applies systemd units automatically)
```

**The pipeline must work end-to-end before adding features.**

---

### 3. GitOps Configuration

```
gitops-{project}/
├── base/
│   └── {app}/
│       ├── deployment.yaml
│       ├── service.yaml
│       └── kustomization.yaml
│
└── envs/
    ├── test/
    │   └── {app}/
    │       └── kustomization.yaml    # image: :test-{sha}
    ├── staging/
    │   └── {app}/
    │       └── kustomization.yaml    # image: :staging-{sha}
    └── prod/
        └── {app}/
            └── kustomization.yaml    # image: :v1.0.0
```

**All environments configured before any features.**

---

### 4. The Skeleton Desk

**`initialize_{dossier}_v1`** — The simplest possible desk.

**Purpose:** Create a dossier with minimal data.

**CMD:**
```erlang
%% initialize_capability_v1.erl
-record(initialize_capability_v1, {
    mri :: binary()
}).

new(MRI) ->
    #initialize_capability_v1{mri = MRI}.
```

```erlang
%% capability_initialized_v1.erl
-record(capability_initialized_v1, {
    mri :: binary(),
    initialized_at :: integer()
}).
```

```erlang
%% maybe_initialize_capability.erl
handle(Cmd) ->
    Event = capability_initialized_v1:from_command(Cmd),
    {ok, Event}.
```

**PRJ:**
```erlang
%% capability_initialized_to_capabilities.erl
project(Event) ->
    Row = #{
        mri => Event#capability_initialized_v1.mri,
        status => <<"initialized">>,
        created_at => Event#capability_initialized_v1.initialized_at
    },
    query_capabilities_store:upsert(capabilities, Row).
```

**QRY:**
```erlang
%% find_capability.erl
execute(#{mri := MRI}) ->
    query_capabilities_store:get(capabilities, MRI).
```

**Why this desk?**
- No business logic (just creates empty dossier)
- Tests full CMD → PRJ → QRY flow
- Safe to deploy to production
- Proves infrastructure works

## The Skeleton Checklist

### Day 1 Tasks

- [ ] Create codebase scaffold
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Configure GitOps repos
- [ ] Implement `initialize_{dossier}_v1` desk
- [ ] Implement projection to read model
- [ ] Implement simple query

### Day 1 Verifications

- [ ] `rebar3 compile` passes
- [ ] `rebar3 dialyzer` clean
- [ ] `rebar3 eunit` passes
- [ ] CI pipeline runs successfully
- [ ] Deployed to TEST environment
- [ ] Deployed to STAGING environment
- [ ] Deployed to PROD environment

### Smoke Tests (All Environments)

```bash
# Health check
curl https://{env}.example.com/health
# → 200 OK

# Initialize a dossier
curl -X POST https://{env}.example.com/api/{dossier}/init \
  -d '{"mri": "test-001"}'
# → 201 Created

# Query the dossier
curl https://{env}.example.com/api/{dossier}/test-001
# → 200 OK, {"mri": "test-001", "status": "initialized"}
```

## Done When: an mcl-* Service on the Fleet

> **Code doesn't walk, a deployment does.**

The checklist above is the general shape. For a Macula service it comes down
to the steps below, in order, each with the evidence that closes it.
Everything before step 6 is code; the skeleton walks only at step 10. First
walked by mcl-jobs (2026-10-08).

| # | Step | Done when |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | **Scaffold** from mcl-om's `mcl_service` template (`store=1` for an event-sourced service; Apache-2.0 and GitHub runners for a public repo) | The generated tests, lint and dialyzer pass untouched |
| 2 | **C4 model**: `architecture/README.md`, SVGs in `assets/`, linked from the README | Each SVG rendered with rsvg-convert and looked at |
| 3 | **CMD division(s)**: `initiate_{dossier}` and one terminal desk (`archive_{dossier}`), status as `evoq_bit_flags`, rules in the aggregate | Every rule has a test: initiate twice, act on what was never initiated, end twice |
| 4 | **Mesh procedures**: one responder per desk, listed in `capabilities/0`, acting as the CALL's `caller` (never an identity from the payload), replying `{}` or `{"reason": "<text>"}` | Reasons documented as the wire contract; responder tests show the caller binding; every capability carries `confidential => required` when it moves personal data (a call goes in the clear otherwise); authorization design passed a Fable gate |
| 5 | **`scripts/smoke.sh`**: calls the deployed procedures with fresh identities, including a repeat that only a stored event can refuse | Runs against the mesh; fails cleanly (`no_provider`) before the deploy |
| 6 | **Release**: version-only commit, `v<semver>` tag | CI publishes the image signed and attested by digest |
| 7 | **Fleet entry** in macula-fleet: the lightest box, data on `/bulk*`, pinned `<semver>@sha256:<digest>`, an image-signers line and a release-targets line | The box reconciles; container healthy; store files on the data drive |
| 8 | **Realm admission**: the boot claim shows as pending on the Providers desk, and a human admits it | `<org>/info` answers on the mesh with the released version and the box |
| 9 | **Smoke against the deployment** | `scripts/smoke.sh` exits 0, and reports the calls sealed where step 4 requires it |
| 10 | **Close the plan issue** with the purpose met or not, and the evidence (shas, digest, smoke output) | The issue is closed |

One push ask covers steps 6 and 7 (the code range, the tag and the fleet
commit, in that order); step 8 is the human act it names. Query sides,
projections and features come after step 10, never before.

## When the Skeleton Walks

**You know the skeleton works when:**

1. Code compiles and passes all checks
2. CI/CD pipeline is green
3. GitOps syncs to all environments
4. Health checks pass in all environments
5. You can create and query a dossier in PROD

**Only then do you add features.**

---

## Adding Features

Once the skeleton walks, each feature follows the same path:

```
1. Implement desk locally
2. Write tests
3. Verify (compile, dialyzer, eunit)
4. Push to trigger CI
5. CI deploys to TEST
6. Verify in TEST
7. Merge to main
8. CI deploys to STAGING
9. Verify in STAGING
10. Tag for PROD release
11. CI deploys to PROD
12. Verify in PROD
```

**Every feature walks the same infrastructure the skeleton proved.**

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Skipping PROD | "We'll deploy later" | Deploy skeleton to PROD on day 1 |
| Complex skeleton | Too much in first slice | Keep it minimal (initialize only) |
| Manual deploys | "Just this once" | GitOps from the start |
| Skipping tests | "Skeleton is trivial" | Test infrastructure matters |
| Separate skeleton branch | Never merges | Skeleton goes to main |

---

## The Doctrine

> **If you can't deploy an empty system to production on day 1, you have infrastructure problems.**
>
> **Find them now, not after you've built features.**

The Walking Skeleton is not optional. It is the **first task** of every project.
