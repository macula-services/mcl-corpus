# NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md — Consolidated Quick Reference

_Single-page reference for all naming conventions in the Domain/Division/Desk architecture._
_An LLM doing TnI codegen reads ONLY this file + the relevant template._

> **Authority on integration-actor names.** The actor forms below (emitters as `emit_{event}_to_{transport}`, listeners as `on_{fact}_from_{transport}_{command}`) follow the dated decision in [INTEGRATION_ACTORS.md](INTEGRATION_ACTORS.md) (2026-03-14). If the two files ever diverge on emitter/listener naming, INTEGRATION_ACTORS.md wins. Policy (`on_{event}_maybe_{command}`) is deliberately distinct from Listener and is **not** affected.

## Event Flows from the Store

Every event stored in ReckonDB can trigger one of 4 flow types. Each has a distinct naming pattern and role:

| # | Flow | Module Pattern | Role |
|---|------|---------------|------|
| 1 | Event Store → Read Model | `on_{event}_to_sqlite_{table}` / `on_{event}_to_couchdb_{table}` | **Projection** |
| 2 | Event Store → Mesh | `emit_{event}_to_mesh` | **Mesh Emitter** |
| 3 | Event Store → own Aggregate | `on_{event}_maybe_{command}` | **Policy** |
| 4 | Other Service/Mesh → own Aggregate | `on_{fact}_from_{transport}_{command}` | **Listener** |

All 5 subscribe to events via `reckon_evoq_adapter:subscribe/5`. The difference is what they DO with the event:

- **Projection** (1): Writes to a read model (SQLite, CouchDB). Lives in the PRJ app.
- **Integration Emitter** (2): Broadcasts to OTP `pg` groups for inter-domain consumption. Lives in CMD desk.
- **Mesh Emitter** (3): Publishes to Macula mesh for WAN/cross-network consumption. Lives in CMD desk.
- **Policy** (4): Reacts to an internal domain event, dispatches a command to own aggregate. Lives as a sibling slice in the target CMD app under `apps/{cmd_app}/src/on_{event}_{action}_{target}/`.
- **Listener** (5): Reacts to a FACT from outside (another domain via pg, or mesh), dispatches a local command. Lives as a sibling slice in the target CMD app under `apps/{cmd_app}/src/on_{fact}_from_{transport}_{command}/`. (Reversed 2026-03-12 — was originally "inside the target desk"; see Demon 18.)

### Policy vs Listener

Both dispatch commands. The difference is the SOURCE of the trigger:

| Name | Source | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Policy** | Internal domain event (own event store) | `on_license_revoked_v1_maybe_remove_plugin` |
| **Listener** | External fact (pg from another domain, or mesh) | `on_app_available_from_mesh_install_plugin` |

## Command Entry Points

A command is NOT always triggered by an API call. There are three entry points:

| Entry Point | Pattern | Name | Source |
|-------------|---------|------|--------|
| API call (HOPE) | `{command}_api.erl` | **API Handler** | User/frontend via HTTP |
| Internal domain event | `on_{event}_maybe_{command}.erl` | **Policy** | Own event store |
| External fact | `on_{fact}_from_{transport}_{command}.erl` | **Listener** | Another domain via pg/mesh |

A command without an API handler is NOT dead code — it may only be triggered by policies or listeners. The audit question is: "does every command have at least one entry point?"

### Department Ownership

| Flow | Lives in | Department |
|------|----------|------------|
| Projection | `apps/project_{plural}/src/{event}/` | PRJ |
| Integration Emitter | `apps/{cmd_app}/src/{desk}/` | CMD |
| Mesh Emitter | `apps/{cmd_app}/src/{desk}/` | CMD |
| Policy | `apps/{cmd_app}/src/on_{event}_{action}_{target}/` (sibling of desks) | CMD |
| Listener | `apps/{cmd_app}/src/on_{fact}_from_{transport}_{command}/` (sibling of desks) | CMD |

---

## Division App Structure (CMD / PRJ / QRY)

Every division with event sourcing has three separate apps:

| Department | Naming Pattern | Example | Responsibility |
|-----------|---------------|---------|---------------|
| **CMD** | `guide_{aggregate}_lifecycle` or `{process_verb}_{subject}` | `guide_license_lifecycle` | Commands, events, aggregates, emitters, PMs |
| **PRJ** | `project_{domain}` or `project_{read_model_plural}` | `project_appstore` | Projections, SQLite store, event subscriptions |
| **QRY** | `query_{domain}` or `query_{read_model_plural}` | `query_appstore` | API handlers, reads from SQLite |

PRJ and QRY are SEPARATE apps. PRJ writes read models, QRY reads them. Different responsibilities.

---

## Derivation Rules (Input -> Convention -> Output)

Given a dossier/app name, all other names are **deterministic**:

### From App Name

| Input | Convention | Output |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| `process_orders` | strip prefix | aggregate noun: `order` |
| `process_orders` | strip prefix, keep plural | aggregate plural: `orders` |
| `process_orders` | pair with query | query app: `query_orders` |

### From Command Desk Name

| Input | Convention | Output |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| `initiate_order` | `_v1` suffix | command module: `initiate_order_v1` |
| `initiate_order` | past tense + `_v1` | event module: `order_initiated_v1` |
| `initiate_order` | `maybe_` prefix | handler: `maybe_initiate_order` |
| `initiate_order` | `_api` suffix | API handler: `initiate_order_api` |
| `initiate_order` | `_desk_sup` suffix | supervisor: `initiate_order_desk_sup` |
| `initiate_order` | `_responder_v1` suffix | responder: `initiate_order_responder_v1` |
| `initiate_order` | event `_to_mesh` | emitter: `emit_order_initiated_to_mesh` |

### From PRJ Desk Name (Event-Based)

PRJ desk directories are named after the **triggering event** (version-agnostic).
Modules inside keep their full `{event}_v{N}_to_{target}` names.

| Input | Convention | Output |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| `order_initiated` | directory name | desk dir: `order_initiated/` |
| `order_initiated` | `_sup` suffix | supervisor: `order_initiated_sup` |
| `order_initiated` | `_v1_to_{target}` | projection module: `order_initiated_v1_to_orders` |
| `order_initiated` | `_v2_to_{target}` | projection module: `order_initiated_v2_to_orders` |

Multiple versions and targets coexist in the same desk directory.

### From Query Desk Name

| Input | Convention | Output |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| `get_order_by_id` | `_api` suffix | API handler: `get_order_by_id_api` |
| `get_orders_page` | `_api` suffix | API handler: `get_orders_page_api` |

---

## Route Pattern Rules

| Desk Type | Route Pattern | Example |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| CMD (create) | `POST /api/{plural}/{verb}` | `POST /api/orders/initiate` |
| CMD (on existing) | `POST /api/{plural}/:id/{verb}` | `POST /api/orders/:id/archive` |
| QRY (paged list) | `GET /api/{plural}` | `GET /api/orders` |
| QRY (by ID) | `GET /api/{plural}/:id` | `GET /api/orders/:order_id` |
| QRY (filtered) | `GET /api/{plural}?{filter}=value` | `GET /api/orders?customer_id=X` |

---

## Mesh Procedure Naming

Every mesh capability advertises on the wire as `Org/Name`: the org
gives the prefix, and `Name` is the capability's own. `Name` is
**verb-first snake_case**: `answer_query`, `get_source_by_id`,
`get_limits`, `set_limits`. A service's headline capability is a bare
noun (`mcl-echo/echo`). Dots belong only to framework-reserved
primitives (`_dht.find_record`) and the framework's synthetic
`<service>.describe_capabilities`; a service capability never names
itself `resource.verb`.

**A service's `capabilities/0` entry and its actual advertised procedure
name must be the same name.** `mcl_embedder`'s own `capabilities/0`
advertises `embed` (dropping "-er") while the real, callable procedure
it registers separately is `mcl-embed/embed` — a different namespace
entirely. Two different names for the same one thing is exactly the
failure mode this rule exists to prevent: a caller discovering `embed`
via the DHT gets `unknown_next_peer` calling it by that name, because
the working procedure was never that name at all.

**A service with no procedures needs no prefix.** A pubsub-only
participant (e.g. `mcl_whiteboard`, which publishes to topics but
advertises no callable procedures) has nothing to prefix — this rule
governs procedure names, not every service in the fleet.

### What this doesn't do

This is the standard for **new** procedures. It does not rename anything
already deployed — `mcl-rag`'s hyphenated prefix, `mcl_embedder`'s
two-different-names problem, and the unprefixed services (`tube`,
`warden`, `sentinel`) are each a live procedure name existing callers
depend on. Migrating any of them is a deliberate, scoped, per-service
decision, not a side effect of this rule existing.

---

## Event Naming Rules

1. **Past tense**: Events describe what happened: `order_initiated`, not `initiate_order`
2. **Version suffix**: Always `_v1`: `order_initiated_v1`
3. **Business verbs only**: No CRUD (`created`, `updated`, `deleted`)
4. **Subject first**: `{subject}_{verb_past}`, not `{verb_past}_{subject}`

### Event Verb Examples

| Action | Event Name | NOT |
|--------|-----------|-----|
| Birth | `{noun}_initiated_v1` | `{noun}_created_v1` |
| Soft delete | `{noun}_archived_v1` | `{noun}_deleted_v1` |
| Phase change | `{noun}_submitted_v1` | `{noun}_updated_v1` |
| Refinement | `{noun}_refined_v1` | `{noun}_modified_v1` |
| Discovery | `{noun}_identified_v1` | `{noun}_found_v1` |

---

## Stream ID Conventions

| Aggregate | Stream Pattern | Example |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| Domain | `domain-{venture_id}` | `domain-019e642a1acf7019a433f0634a035877` |
| Division | `division-{division_id}` | `division-019e643ba9937926b14648f21ec23fc9` |
| Generic | `{aggregate_noun}-{id}` | `order-019e644a8b1d70291a456b5e9c3df8a2` |

**Format contract** (enforced by `reckon_gater_stream_id:validate/1`):

```
^[a-z]{1,32}-[a-f0-9]{32}$
```

Lowercase letters for the prefix (1–32 chars), single hyphen, exactly
32 lowercase hex chars in the suffix. The suffix carries 128 bits of
entropy — one UUID-worth — at a predictable length.

**Use `reckon_gater_stream_id:new(Prefix)` to mint fresh ids.** The
helper uses `reckon_gater_uuid:v7/0` under the hood, so the leading
48 bits of the hex suffix are `unix_ts_ms` — `ORDER BY stream_id`
returns aggregates in birth order without an explicit time column.
Useful for replay tooling, projection grouping, and chronological log
inspection.

```erlang
SessionId = reckon_gater_stream_id:new(<<"sess">>).
%% => <<"sess-019e642a1acf7019a433f0634a035877">>

LotId = reckon_gater_stream_id:new(parking_lot).  %% atom prefix also accepted
%% => <<"parking_lot-019e643ba9937926b14648f21ec23fc9">>
```

**Do NOT hand-roll** with `crypto:strong_rand_bytes/16` + a UUID-v4
formatter. UUID-v4 string output (`9D9D16B6-F56E-...`) fails the
contract: uppercase + internal hyphens. The dispatch returns
`{error, {invalid_stream_id, malformed_user_id, ...}}` — see Demon 49
in `antipatterns/event_sourcing.md` for the entire failure mode.

---

## rebar.config src_dirs Convention

Every desk directory MUST be listed in `src_dirs`:

```erlang
%% CMD app (process_orders)
{src_dirs, [
    "src",
    "src/initiate_order",
    "src/archive_order",
    "src/refine_order"
]}.

%% PRJ app (project_orders) — desk dirs named after the event, version-agnostic
{src_dirs, [
    "src",
    "src/order_initiated",
    "src/order_archived"
]}.

%% QRY app (query_orders)
{src_dirs, [
    "src",
    "src/get_order_by_id",
    "src/get_orders_page"
]}.
```

---

## Status Bit Flags Convention

| Flag | Value | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `STATUS_INITIATED` | `1` (2^0) | Aggregate born |
| `STATUS_ARCHIVED` | varies | Soft-deleted, hidden from queries |
| Domain flags | powers of 2 | Domain-specific states |

Macro naming: `?{AGGREGATE_UPPER}_{FLAG}` (e.g., `?VENTURE_INITIATED`, `?ORDER_ARCHIVED`)

---

## Banned Names

**NEVER use these patterns:**

| Pattern | Why | Correct Alternative |
|---------|-----|-------------------|
| `list_{aggregates}` | Unbounded | `get_{aggregates}_page` |
| `get_all_{aggregates}` | Unbounded | `get_{aggregates}_page` |
| `get_{aggregate}` (raw) | Ambiguous | `get_{aggregate}_by_id` |
| `{noun}_created_v1` | CRUD | `{noun}_initiated_v1` |
| `{noun}_updated_v1` | CRUD | Use business verb |
| `{noun}_deleted_v1` | CRUD | `{noun}_archived_v1` |
| `*_service` | Horizontal layer | Vertical slice |
| `*_handler` | Technical noise | `maybe_{command}` |
| `*_manager` | God module | Domain-specific module |
| `*_helper` / `*_util` | Junk drawer | Put in the desk |

---
