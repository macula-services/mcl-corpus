## 🔥 Demon 19: esqlite3 Returns Lists, Not Tuples

**Date exorcised:** 2026-02-12
**Where it appeared:** 12+ `row_to_map/1` functions across all `query_*` apps
**Cost:** Silent pattern match failure — queries returned `{ok, []}` instead of data

### The Lie

"SQLite rows come back as tuples like `{Col1, Col2, Col3}`."

### What Happened

All `row_to_map/1` functions used tuple patterns:
```erlang
%% WRONG — tuples
row_to_map({Id, Name, Status, Label}) ->
    #{id => Id, name => Name, status => Status, label => Label}.
```

But `esqlite3:fetchall/1` returns rows as **lists of lists**, not lists of tuples:
```erlang
{ok, [[<<"id1">>, <<"name1">>, 1, <<"Active">>],
      [<<"id2">>, <<"name2">>, 2, <<"Done">>]]}
```

The tuple pattern `{Id, Name, Status, Label}` never matches `[Id, Name, Status, Label]`, so the list comprehension `[row_to_map(R) || R <- Rows]` silently produces an empty list.

### The Correct Pattern

```erlang
%% CORRECT — lists
row_to_map([Id, Name, Status, Label]) ->
    #{id => Id, name => Name, status => Status, label => Label}.
```

### Why This Happens

1. Many Erlang database libraries (mnesia, ets) return tuples
2. The mental model "row = tuple" is deeply ingrained
3. Without tests that exercise the full query path, the bug only surfaces at runtime
4. The empty-list result looks like "no data" rather than "pattern match failed"

### Prevention

```erlang
%% Test that row_to_map works with list input
row_to_map_test() ->
    Row = [<<"id">>, <<"name">>, 1, <<"Active">>],
    Result = row_to_map(Row),
    ?assertEqual(<<"id">>, maps:get(id, Result)).
```

### The Lesson

> **esqlite3 returns lists. Always. Test your row_to_map with actual list inputs.**
> **This bug was in the BIT_FLAGS_STATUS_PROJECTION.md template — the "correct" example was wrong.**

## 🔥 Demon 20: Eager Default in `maps:get/3`

**Date exorcised:** 2026-02-12
**Where it appeared:** 10 command modules (`*_v1.erl`) in `mentor_llms`
**Cost:** `noproc` crash when gen_server not running (e.g., in tests)

### The Lie

"Use `maps:get(key, Map, default_value())` to provide a fallback."

### What Happened

Command modules used function calls as `maps:get/3` defaults:
```erlang
%% WRONG — identity_module:agent_id() is ALWAYS called
SubmitterId = maps:get(<<"submitter_id">>, Map, identity_module:agent_id()),
```

In Erlang, `maps:get(Key, Map, Default)` evaluates `Default` **before** checking if `Key` exists. When `Default` is a function call to a gen_server (`identity_module`), it crashes with `noproc` if that server isn't running — even when the key IS present in the map.

### The Correct Pattern

```erlang
%% CORRECT — lazy evaluation via case
SubmitterId = case maps:find(<<"submitter_id">>, Map) of
    {ok, V} -> V;
    error -> identity_module:agent_id()
end,
```

### Why This Happens

1. `maps:get/3` looks like it should be lazy (only use default when key is missing)
2. In many other languages, default values ARE lazy (Python's `dict.get(k, v)` doesn't evaluate `v` eagerly)
3. Erlang evaluates all function arguments before calling the function — there are no lazy arguments
4. The bug only manifests when the gen_server isn't running, which may not happen in production but always happens in unit tests

### When This Matters

| Default Expression | Safe? | Why |
|-------------------|-------|-----|
| `maps:get(k, M, <<>>)` | Yes | Literal — no side effects |
| `maps:get(k, M, undefined)` | Yes | Atom literal |
| `maps:get(k, M, 0)` | Yes | Integer literal |
| `maps:get(k, M, gen_server:call(...))` | **NO** | Evaluated even when key exists |
| `maps:get(k, M, identity_module:agent_id())` | **NO** | gen_server call, crashes if down |
| `maps:get(k, M, os:timestamp())` | **NO** | Side effect always runs |

### The Lesson

> **Never use function calls as `maps:get/3` defaults. Use `maps:find/2` + `case` for lazy evaluation.**
> **If the default is a literal, `maps:get/3` is fine. If it's a function call, it's a bug waiting to happen.**

## 🔥 Demon 21: esqlite3 Argument Order (Db First)

**Date exorcised:** 2026-02-12
**Where it appeared:** 8 `query_*_store.erl` files
**Cost:** `function_clause` crash on store initialization

### The Lie

"Just call `esqlite3:exec(SQL, Db)` — SQL first, then connection."

### What Happened

Store `init/1` functions had the arguments reversed:
```erlang
%% WRONG — SQL first
esqlite3:exec("PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL", Db),
esqlite3:exec("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ...", Db),
```

The esqlite3 API is `esqlite3:exec(Db, SQL)` — connection first:
```erlang
%% CORRECT — Db first
esqlite3:exec(Db, "PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL"),
esqlite3:exec(Db, "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ..."),
```

### The API

| Function | Signature | Note |
|----------|-----------|------|
| `esqlite3:open/1` | `open(Path)` | Returns `{ok, Db}` |
| `esqlite3:exec/2` | `exec(Db, SQL)` | **Db first** |
| `esqlite3:q/2` | `q(Db, SQL)` | **Db first** |
| `esqlite3:q/3` | `q(Db, SQL, Params)` | **Db first** |

### Why This Happens

1. Many Erlang database APIs use `Module:exec(SQL, Connection)` — SQL first
2. The "subject.verb(object)" pattern (`SQL.exec_on(Db)`) feels natural
3. esqlite3 follows the C SQLite API convention where the handle comes first
4. Without type specs or dialyzer, the crash only appears at runtime

### The Lesson

> **esqlite3: connection (Db) ALWAYS comes first. `exec(Db, SQL)`, `q(Db, SQL, Params)`.**
> **When in doubt, check the esqlite3 source — don't assume argument order from other libraries.**

## 🔥 gen_server Self-Call Deadlock

**Date:** 2026-03-05
**Origin:** reckon_db emitter pool fix deadlocked on `is_active/1`

### The Antipattern

Calling a gen_server from within its own process via a function that does `gen_server:call`:

```erlang
%% In reckon_db_leader handle_cast({activate, StoreId}, State):
%%   → save_default_subscriptions(StoreId)
%%     → subscribe/5
%%       → setup_event_notification
%%         → reckon_db_leader:is_active(StoreId)  %% gen_server:call back to self!
%%           → DEADLOCK
```

### Why It's Wrong

`gen_server:call` sends a message and waits for a reply. If the target is the calling process itself, the process is already handling a message and can't process the call. Erlang raises `{calling_self, {gen_server, call, [...]}}`.

### The Correct Pattern

Use a non-blocking check that doesn't require the gen_server to respond:

```erlang
%% CORRECT — check if the supervisor process exists via whereis/1
SupName = reckon_db_naming:emitter_sup_name(StoreId),
maybe_start_emitter_pool(StoreId, Key, Sub, whereis(SupName)).

maybe_start_emitter_pool(_StoreId, _Key, _Sub, undefined) -> ok;
maybe_start_emitter_pool(StoreId, Key, Sub, _SupPid) ->
    case reckon_db_emitter_pool:start_emitter(StoreId, Sub) of
        {ok, _Pid} ->
            logger:info("Started emitter pool for ~s (store: ~p)", [Key, StoreId]);
        {error, {already_started, _}} -> ok;
        {error, _} -> ok
    end.
```

**Rule:** If a function might be called from inside a gen_server, never use `gen_server:call` to query that same server. Use `whereis/1`, ETS lookups, or process dictionary reads instead.

## 🔥 Demon 38: Emoji Literals in esqlite3 SQL Strings

**Date exorcised:** 2026-03-06
**Where it appeared:** `project_launcher_store:create_tables/1` and 3 projection modules
**Cost:** `badarg` crash on startup — the service crash-loops, never boots

### The Lie

"Just put the emoji in the SQL DEFAULT value: `DEFAULT '🔌'`."

### What Happened

The SQLite CREATE TABLE statement had emoji literals in DEFAULT clauses:
```erlang
%% WRONG — emoji literal in SQL string
esqlite3:exec(Db,
    "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS launcher_entries ("
    "  icon TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '🔌'"
    ");").
```

`esqlite3_nif:exec/2` received a charlist containing codepoints > 127 (the plug emoji U+1F50C is 4 bytes in UTF-8: `\xF0\x9F\x94\x8C`). The NIF expects iodata but chokes on the high codepoints, crashing with `badarg`. The error is buried in a kernel pid termination message — no clear "emoji bad" error.

### The Correct Pattern

Use UTF-8 byte escapes in Erlang binaries, passed as bind parameters:
```erlang
%% CORRECT — byte escapes in binary, passed as bind parameter
project_launcher_store:execute(
    "INSERT INTO launcher_groups (name, icon) VALUES (?1, ?2)",
    [GroupName, <<"\xF0\x9F\x93\x81">>]).

%% CORRECT — empty default in DDL, real icon comes from event data
"icon TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT ''"
```

For SQL DDL (CREATE TABLE), use empty string defaults — the actual emoji values come from event data via bind parameters, which handle UTF-8 correctly.

### Common Emoji Byte Sequences

| Emoji | UTF-8 Bytes | Erlang Binary |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| 📁 (folder) | F0 9F 93 81 | `<<"\xF0\x9F\x93\x81">>` |
| 🔌 (plug) | F0 9F 94 8C | `<<"\xF0\x9F\x94\x8C">>` |
| ⚙️ (gear) | E2 9A 99 EF B8 8F | `<<"\xE2\x9A\x99\xEF\xB8\x8F">>` |

### Why This Happens

1. Erlang strings are charlists — `"🔌"` is `[128268]`, a single codepoint > 127
2. esqlite3's NIF expects iodata (binaries or byte-range charlists)
3. High codepoints in charlists are NOT valid iodata
4. The crash message is opaque: `{badarg, [{esqlite3_nif, exec, [#Ref<...>, [67,82,69,65,...]]}]}` — just raw codepoints
5. Binaries with `\xNN` escapes ARE valid UTF-8 iodata and pass through cleanly

### The Lesson

> **Never put emoji (or any non-ASCII) directly in esqlite3 SQL strings.**
> **Use `<<"\xF0\x9F\x...">>` binaries as bind parameters. Use empty defaults in DDL.**
> **This applies to all esqlite3 functions: `exec/2`, `prepare/2`, etc.**

## 🔥 Demon 60: Mesh RPC Payloads Arrive Atom-Keyed AND CBOR-Value-Wrapped

**Date exorcised:** 2026-09-01 (two-part fix: keys in `mcl_om` 0.19.0, values in 0.20.0 — see "Part 2" below, found live only after the key fix alone still didn't resolve the symptom)
**Where it appeared:** 12+ entry points across `mcl-rag` (`route/2` clauses, every `*_v1.erl` command's `from_map/1`, `search_chunks_semantic`, `list_chunks_by_source`, `list_sources_page`, `maybe_classify_topics`) — `mcl_om_wire.erl`'s own moduledoc names `mcl-dns`/`-git`/`-llm`/`-rag` as the same "zero tolerance" victims for the key half; the value half lived inside `mcl_om_wire.erl` itself, so it affects every consumer of `field/2,3` project-wide, not just the services named there
**Cost:** Most of `mcl-rag`'s mesh RPC surface silently broken for real callers, for BOTH reasons simultaneously — three failure shapes for the key mismatch, and a fourth (a correctly-found field that's still the wrong Erlang shape) for the value one — none of them looking like "this request was well-formed and still failed"

## Part 1: The Key Lie

"The caller sent JSON with string keys, so the payload map I receive will have binary keys — I can pattern-match `#{<<"field">> := V}` directly."

### What Happened

macula's frame decoder round-trips an inbound RPC payload's keys through `binary_to_existing_atom/1` on the way in. A caller that sends `{"corpus_id": "x"}` over the wire gets it delivered server-side as `#{corpus_id => <<"x">>}` — an **atom**-keyed map — not `#{<<"corpus_id">> => <<"x">>}`. Every handler in `mcl-rag` was written assuming the opposite, and this produced three different-looking failures depending on exactly where the assumption lived:

```erlang
%% route/2 destructuring the key directly (get_document_verbatim,
%% get_chunk_by_id, get_source_by_id) -- the clause's OWN pattern fails
%% to match, Erlang falls through every other clause, and lands on the
%% generic catch-all:
route(<<"mcl-rag.get_document_verbatim">>, #{<<"source_path">> := Path}) ->
    get_document_verbatim:handle(Path);
...
route(Other, _P) ->
    {error, {unknown_method, Other}}.
%% Result: a real, deployed, correctly-advertised procedure comes back
%% "unknown_method" -- indistinguishable from a typo'd procedure name
%% or a station that never learned the route. A multi-hour investigation
%% chased tombstone races, gossip propagation lag, and ADVERTISE-burst
%% rate limits before finding this -- all plausible, all wrong, because
%% the actual symptom (unknown_method) looks EXACTLY like a routing
%% failure, not an argument-shape failure.

%% A command's from_map/1 destructuring the key one level down
%% (detect_corpus_change_v1, schedule_reembed_v1, and 7 others) --
%% route/2 itself matches fine (it just passes the whole map through),
%% but the command's own hard pattern fails and falls through to ITS
%% catch-all:
from_map(#{<<"corpus_id">> := Id} = Map) -> {ok, #detect_corpus_change_v1{...}};
from_map(_) -> {error, missing_aggregate_id}.
%% Result: a call with a genuinely present, correctly-typed corpus_id
%% comes back "missing_aggregate_id" -- a BELIEVABLE, domain-sounding
%% validation error that is not what actually happened. This is the
%% dangerous one: it doesn't crash, doesn't route-fail, just quietly
%% tells the caller they forgot a field they didn't forget. A live test
%% that "successfully" reached this exact error was wrongly read as
%% proof the call worked, sending the same investigation down a wrong
%% path for over an hour before the real mechanism was found.

%% search_chunks_semantic's dual-shape dispatch -- neither shape
%% matches, falls through to the map-shaped catch-all:
handle(#{<<"query_vector">> := V} = P) when is_list(V) -> ...;
handle(#{<<"query_text">> := T} = P) when is_binary(T) -> ...;
handle(Params) when is_map(Params) -> {error, query_text_or_vector_required}.
%% Result: a caller who DID supply query_text gets told they supplied
%% neither query_text nor query_vector.
```

### The Correct Pattern

Use `mcl_om_wire:field/2,3` (ships with `mcl_om`) everywhere a payload's own field is read — it tries the atom form first, then the binary form, so it's correct for BOTH a mesh-delivered (atom-keyed) payload and an HTTP/jsx-decoded (binary-keyed only) payload hitting the same code path:

```erlang
%% route/2 -- pass the whole map through instead of destructuring in
%% the clause head, and look the field up where it's actually needed:
route(<<"mcl-rag.get_document_verbatim">>, P) ->
    get_document_verbatim:handle(mcl_om_wire:field(<<"source_path">>, P));

%% from_map/1 -- dispatch on the field's presence via a second function
%% clause (idiomatic, no case/if) instead of pattern-matching it in the
%% head:
from_map(Map) when is_map(Map) ->
    from_map_(mcl_om_wire:field(<<"corpus_id">>, Map), Map);
from_map(_) ->
    {error, missing_aggregate_id}.

from_map_(undefined, _Map) -> {error, missing_aggregate_id};
from_map_(Id, Map) ->
    {ok, #detect_corpus_change_v1{
        corpus_id = Id,
        source_path = mcl_om_wire:field(<<"source_path">>, Map),
        ...
    }}.
```

Deploying this fix alone did NOT resolve the live symptom — see Part 2. The reason turned out to be that fixing the key half only gets a caller's field FOUND; it says nothing about what SHAPE the found value is in.

## Part 2: The Value Lie

"Now that `mcl_om_wire:field/2` finds the right key, the value it returns is the plain Erlang term I asked for."

### What Happened

After Part 1 shipped, `get_document_verbatim`/`get_source_by_id`/`get_chunk_by_id` stopped returning `unknown_method` — progress — but started returning `missing_source_path`/`missing_id` instead, even for a real, present field. A temporary diagnostic log (`logger:warning` on the raw payload, then removed once the answer was in hand) showed the actual value:

```erlang
#{source_path => {text, <<"hecate-corpus/CODEX.md">>}}
```

The key was exactly right. The VALUE was wrapped in a 2-tuple. Per `macula_record_cbor`'s own documented value representation, a JSON string sent as an RPC arg is encoded as a CBOR text string (major type 3), which decodes to `{text, binary()}` in Erlang — a bare `binary()` is reserved for a CBOR BYTE string (major type 2), a genuinely different wire type CBOR itself distinguishes and Erlang binaries alone cannot. `mcl_om_wire:field/2,3` found the key correctly and returned the tuple unchanged, so every `is_binary/1` guard downstream kept failing — indistinguishable, again, from a missing field. This recurses: a `topics :: [binary()]` field decodes to a list of `{text, _}` tuples, and a `hits :: [map()]` field (a caller round-tripping a prior response's hits back in) decodes to a list of maps whose OWN values need the identical unwrap.

### The Correct Pattern (Part 2)

Fixed inside `mcl_om_wire.erl` itself (`mcl_om` 0.20.0), so every existing `field/2,3` call site gets it automatically — no changes needed at any of the Part 1 call sites:

```erlang
-spec unwrap(term()) -> term().
unwrap({text, Bin}) when is_binary(Bin) -> Bin;
unwrap(null) -> undefined;
unwrap(List) when is_list(List) -> [unwrap(V) || V <- List];
unwrap(Map) when is_map(Map) -> maps:map(fun(_K, V) -> unwrap(V) end, Map);
unwrap(Other) -> Other.

lookup(AtomKey, BinKey, Payload, Default) ->
    case maps:find(AtomKey, Payload) of
        {ok, Value} -> unwrap(Value);
        error -> unwrap(maps:get(BinKey, Payload, Default))
    end.
```

### Why This Happens

1. `from_map/1` *reads* as "decode this map from the wire," so writing it as "the wire always sends binary keys" feels self-evidently true — it's exactly backwards for macula specifically.
2. The four failure shapes across both parts (`unknown_method`, a believable domain error, a believable "you forgot a field" error, and Part 2's "found the key, still says missing") are all indistinguishable from a genuinely different, unrelated bug — none of them look like an argument-decoding problem, so debugging effort gets spent everywhere except the actual mechanism. A multi-hour investigation chased tombstone races, gossip propagation lag, and ADVERTISE-burst rate limits before Part 1 was even found — all plausible, all wrong.
3. `mcl_om_wire.erl` — the Part 1 fix already existed, shipped with `mcl_om`, and its own moduledoc names this exact codebase as a known victim — but nothing forced any of the affected `route/2`/`from_map/1` call sites to actually adopt it. A correct library sitting unused fixes nothing.
4. A test that reaches a downstream, domain-shaped error looks like a passing test at a glance. `detect_corpus_change_from_map_does_not_silently_lose_a_real_corpus_id_test` — asserting the result is NOT `{error, missing_aggregate_id}` given a real corpus_id — is the shape of test Part 1 needed; a test that only checks "does this return an error tuple of SOME kind" would pass on both the broken and fixed code.
5. Verifying Part 1's fix worked "in isolation" (a direct `erl -pa` call, or a unit test hand-constructing an atom-keyed map with plain binary values) proved the LOGIC was correct for the shape it was tested against — but that hand-built shape wasn't the real wire shape. Only a live diagnostic against the actual running system surfaced the `{text, _}` wrapping; no amount of reasoning about the fix from first principles found it, because the fix was reasoning about a payload shape that didn't match what was actually on the wire.

### The Lesson

> **Any function reading a field out of a payload that arrived over the mesh — `route/2` clauses, every `from_map/1`, every `handle/1` — must use `mcl_om_wire:field/2,3` (>= 0.20.0), never a hard `#{<<"key">> := V}` pattern or `maps:get(<<"key">>, Map, Default)` literal. If `mcl_om_wire.erl`'s own moduledoc names your service, grep your `route/2` and every `from_map/1` for `#{<<"` in a function head — don't wait to find each one live.**
> **A fix that's correct against a hand-constructed test payload is not yet confirmed correct against the real wire shape — when a fix doesn't resolve the live symptom, get a live diagnostic of the ACTUAL payload before revising the theory further. Guessing from documentation and source code alone found Part 1; only reading real bytes off the wire found Part 2.**
> **When a fresh finding overturns your own recent conclusion mid-investigation, say so plainly and explain the mechanism precisely, rather than quietly folding it in as if it were expected.**

## 🔥🔥🔥 Demon 61: The Store That Stores Without Indexing

**Date:** 2026-09-02
**Repo:** macula-services/mcl-rag (barrel: `barrel_docdb` + `barrel_vectordb`)

### The Lie

> "The store owns embedding. Writing a document puts it in the index."

### What Happened

`rag_store` opens barrel in record mode with an embedding policy of
`fields => []`, which means barrel embeds **nothing** on its own: every
vector is the caller's to compute and to carry. Two separate write paths
forgot that, in two different ways, and both failed in complete silence.

**Half one — a write with no vector.** `put_chunk/3` writes content and
metadata and no vector. The corpus git loop and the bulk seeder both used
it. Every markdown file the mesh ingested was fetchable byte-for-byte and
invisible to semantic search, for months. `get_document_verbatim` was
perfect, which is exactly what made it look fine.

**Half two — a read-modify-write.** Attaching topic labels to a chunk read
the document back and wrote it again with the labels on it:

```erlang
{ok, Doc} = barrel:get_doc(Db, ChunkId),
barrel:put_doc(Db, Doc#{<<"topics">> => Topics})   %% ← chunk leaves the index
```

`barrel:get_doc/2` does **not** return `<<"_embedding">>` — the vector
lives in its own column and never appears in the read body. So the
re-written document carries no vector, matches no embedding rule under
`fields => []`, and barrel resolves the write to `deindex`. The document
survives in the document store and drops out of vector search. Two live
capabilities (`classify_topics`, and `add_knowledge`'s `topics` field)
silently made every chunk they touched unsearchable.

Both halves return `ok`. Neither logs anything.

### The Correct Pattern

Ingestion embeds first, then writes content and vector together:

```erlang
%% Every ingestion desk goes through the one embedding worker.
{Stored, Errors} = rag_chunk_embedder:embed_and_store(Chunks).
```

A metadata-only update carries the stored vector back onto the write:

```erlang
{ok, Doc} = barrel:get_doc(Db, ChunkId),
Updated = case barrel:vector_get(Db, ChunkId) of
              {ok, #{vector := V}} when is_list(V) -> Doc#{<<"_embedding">> => V};
              _NoVector                            -> Doc   %% never indexed; keep it that way
          end,
barrel:put_doc(Db, Updated#{<<"topics">> => Topics}).
```

`barrel:vector_get/2` returns `{ok, #{vector := [float()], text := binary(),
metadata := map()}}`. Its `text` is empty for a client-supplied vector —
barrel only keeps text it embedded itself, which is the same reason a
search hit comes back with no content and the content has to be read from
the document store.

### Why This Happens

1. The names promise indexing. `put_chunk`, in a module called
   `rag_store`, in a database whose whole point is vector search, reads as
   "the chunk is now searchable." Nothing in the call says otherwise.
2. Both module docs asserted the opposite of the code, and had for
   months: "embedding happens automatically (barrel record-mode policy),
   no separate embed call to make here." True of an earlier policy,
   false since `fields => []`. Demon 53 again.
3. The failure is invisible from every direction an operator looks. Exact
   fetch works. Listing works. Ingestion reports success and real chunk
   counts. Only a semantic query fails, and it fails by returning
   somebody else's older documents rather than an error.
4. A read-modify-write is the most ordinary shape in the language. Nothing
   about `Doc#{<<"topics">> => Topics}` suggests it is destroying an index
   entry, and the vector it drops was never visible in `Doc` to begin with.

### Prevention

Not another line in a document — a test that fails.

- The regression that found half two already existed and was red:
  `knowledge_pipeline_SUITE:add_knowledge_with_topics` tags a chunk and
  then asserts the tagged chunk is still a search hit. It had been read as
  flaky. **A red test is a finding until proven otherwise.**
- Every ingestion path gets a round trip that ends in `search_text`, not
  in "the document is there." Fetching it back proves storage, which was
  never the broken half.
- Confirm a storage library's behaviour against the library, not against
  its documentation. Both halves here were settled in minutes by a
  standalone probe: put with a vector, search, get and re-put the same
  body, search again.

### The Lesson

> **When a store makes the caller own the vector, every write path that
> forgets it fails silently, and a read-modify-write forgets it by
> default. Ask of any storage write: which index does this update, and
> what happens to that index if this field is absent?**

> **"The document is retrievable" and "the document is findable" are two
> different claims, and verifying the first tells you nothing about the
> second.**

## 🔥🔥 Demon 65: Mesh Pubsub Facts Arrive `{text, Bin}`-Keyed — Demon 60's Atomization Was RPC, Not Pubsub

**Date exorcised:** 2026-09-25
**Where it appeared:** `macula-services/mcl-bookclub-observer`'s three fact
policies (`on_member_registered_fact_maybe_record` and siblings), first fleet
rollout — the consumer half of mcl-bookclub's mesh facts
**Cost:** A full live-debugging session on beam03. The mesh delivered every
fact; the observer recorded nothing. Zero errors anywhere — the policies
skipped the facts as malformed and `skip` is silent by design.

### The Lie

"Demon 60 says the frame decoder atomizes inbound payload keys, so a pubsub
fact's map has atom keys — I can `maps:get(member_id, Fact)`."

### What Happened

Demon 60's atomization was the **RPC** wire. The **pubsub** wire is different:
a fact's payload arrives with its keys as `{text, Bin}` tuples — the frame
decoder does NOT atomize them — and its string values `{text, Bin}`-wrapped.
The policies read `maps:get(Key, Fact, maps:get(atom_to_binary(Key), Fact,
undefined))` — atom, then binary, both missing — fell through to `skip`, and
"skip a malformed fact" is the *correct* behaviour for the wrong reason, so
nothing logged anything.

The probe that broke the case open: subscribe **and** publish to the same
topic in one eval on the live node. The fresh subscriber received the event —
delivery was fine, the wired subscriber's parse was not. The event's payload
showed the truth directly: `#{{text, <<"key">>} => 1}`.

### The Fix

Read every mesh fact with `mcl_om_wire:field/2`, which resolves the atom,
binary and `{text, Bin}` key forms AND unwraps the value in one call — the
listeners pass the payload through untouched, the policies take what field/2
gives them. The mechanism that refuses a relapse is a test feeding the exact
wire shape a live subscriber receives, `{text, Bin}` keys and values included:
a hand-rolled `maps:get` fails it on the first run.

### The Rule

> **Demon 60 covers RPC. Pubsub payloads are keyed `{text, Bin}`.**
> **Never hand-roll a `maps:get` over a mesh payload — `mcl_om_wire:field/2`
> is the one tool for both shapes, and a test that feeds the live wire
> shape is what keeps the two demons from being re-exorcised a third time.**
