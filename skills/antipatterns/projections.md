## 🔥 Read-Time Status Enrichment

**Date:** 2026-02-10
**Origin:** the removed daemon domain/division status handling

### The Antipattern

Computing `status_label` at query time instead of storing it in the read model at projection write time.

**Symptoms:**
```erlang
%% BAD: Query module enriches at read time
list(Opts) ->
    {ok, Rows} = store:query("SELECT * FROM domains"),
    [enrich_status(row_to_map(R)) || R <- Rows].

enrich_status(#{status := Status} = Row) ->
    Label = evoq_bit_flags:to_string(Status, venture_aggregate:flag_map()),
    Row#{status_label => Label}.
```

**Related violations:**
- Magic numbers: `Status = 3` instead of `evoq_bit_flags:set_all(0, [?VENTURE_INITIATED, ?VENTURE_DNA_ACTIVE])`
- Duplicated flags: `-define(ARCHIVED, 32)` redefined in projections instead of using shared `.hrl`
- Query modules importing aggregate internals (`venture_aggregate:flag_map()`)
- Binary key mismatch: Projections match `#{venture_id := ...}` but events arrive with `<<"venture_id">>` keys

### The Rule

> **Read models store DENORMALIZED data. Compute everything at write time (projection), never at read time (query).**

### The Correct Pattern

**1. Extract flag macros to `.hrl` header in CMD app:**
```erlang
%% apps/setup_venture/include/venture_status.hrl
-define(VENTURE_INITIATED,   1).
-define(VENTURE_DNA_ACTIVE,  2).
-define(VENTURE_ARCHIVED,   32).

-define(VENTURE_FLAG_MAP, #{
    0                    => <<"New">>,
    ?VENTURE_INITIATED   => <<"Initiated">>,
    ?VENTURE_DNA_ACTIVE  => <<"Discovering">>,
    ?VENTURE_ARCHIVED    => <<"Archived">>
}).
```

**2. Projection computes and stores `status_label` at write time:**
```erlang
-include_lib("setup_venture/include/venture_status.hrl").

project(Event) ->
    VentureId = get(venture_id, Event),
    Status = evoq_bit_flags:set_all(0, [?VENTURE_INITIATED, ?VENTURE_DNA_ACTIVE]),
    Label = evoq_bit_flags:to_string(Status, ?VENTURE_FLAG_MAP),
    store:execute(
        "INSERT INTO domains (venture_id, status, status_label) VALUES (?1, ?2, ?3)",
        [VentureId, Status, Label]).
```

**3. Query module reads `status_label` directly — no enrichment:**
```erlang
list(Opts) ->
    {ok, Rows} = store:query("SELECT venture_id, status, status_label FROM domains"),
    [row_to_map(R) || R <- Rows].
%% NO enrich_status function at all
```

**4. Handle binary keys from events (events arrive with binary keys from evoq/ReckonDB):**
```erlang
get(Key, Map) when is_atom(Key) ->
    case maps:find(Key, Map) of
        {ok, V} -> V;
        error -> maps:get(atom_to_binary(Key, utf8), Map, undefined)
    end.
```

### Why It Matters

- **CPU waste**: `enrich_status` runs `evoq_bit_flags:to_string/2` on every row, every query, every request
- **Coupling**: Query modules (PRJ app) depend on aggregate internals (CMD app's `flag_map()`)
- **Inconsistency**: API handlers compute their own labels with hardcoded magic numbers
- **Fragility**: If `flag_map()` changes, all cached/stored data still shows old labels until re-queried
- **CQRS violation**: Read models should be pre-computed and ready to serve — no computation at query time

### The Lesson

> **Projections exist to do the heavy lifting. Queries exist to be dumb and fast.**

## 🔥 Demon 22: Manual Event Emission from API Handlers

**Date exorcised:** 2026-02-13
**Where it appeared:** All 17 storm desk API handlers in `guide_venture_lifecycle`
**Cost:** Projections never received events — read models stayed empty

### The Lie

"After dispatch, the API handler should call emitters to broadcast events."

### What Happened

API handlers manually called pg and mesh emitters after dispatching:

```erlang
%% post_event_sticky_api.erl — WRONG
case maybe_post_event_sticky:dispatch(Cmd) of
    {ok, _Version, Events} ->
        lists:foreach(fun(E) ->
            event_sticky_posted_v1_to_pg:emit(E),    %% Manual call
            event_sticky_posted_v1_to_mesh:emit(E)    %% Manual call
        end, Events),
        mcl_api_utils:json_reply(201, Body, Req);
```

The pg emitter had a simple `emit/1` function that broadcast to a pg group:

```erlang
%% event_sticky_posted_v1_to_pg.erl — WRONG
emit(Event) ->
    Members = pg:get_members(pg, event_sticky_posted_v1),
    lists:foreach(fun(Pid) -> Pid ! {event_sticky_posted_v1, Event} end, Members),
    ok.
```

Projections joined pg groups and waited for messages:

```erlang
%% on_event_sticky_posted_v1_from_pg_project_to_sqlite_event_stickies.erl — WRONG
init([]) ->
    ok = pg:join(pg, event_sticky_posted_v1, self()),
    {ok, #{}}.

handle_info({event_sticky_posted_v1, Event}, State) ->
    event_sticky_posted_v1_to_sqlite_event_stickies:project(Event),
    {noreply, State}.
```

### Why It's Wrong

1. **Fragile coupling** — Every API handler must know which emitters to call for which events. Forget one? Silent data loss.
2. **Wrong responsibility** — The API handler's job is request/response. Event delivery is infrastructure.
3. **No replay** — If an emitter wasn't running when the event was stored, the event is lost forever. No catch-up.
4. **Duplicates on retry** — If the HTTP request is retried, the event is emitted twice (even though evoq deduplicates the command).
5. **Testing burden** — Every API handler test must verify emit calls in addition to dispatch.

### The Truth

**Emitters are projections.** They subscribe to the event store via evoq and react autonomously. The API handler dispatches the command and returns. Period.

ReckonDB has a built-in subscription mechanism:
1. Subscriber calls `reckon_evoq_adapter:subscribe(StoreId, event_type, EventType, Name, #{subscriber_pid => self()})`
2. ReckonDB registers a **Khepri trigger** filtered by event type
3. When events are appended, the trigger fires
4. Subscriber receives `{events, [Event]}` messages automatically

### The Correct Pattern

**API handler — dispatch and return:**
```erlang
%% post_event_sticky_api.erl — CORRECT
case maybe_post_event_sticky:dispatch(Cmd) of
    {ok, _Version, Events} ->
        %% Return response. DONE. No emit calls.
        mcl_api_utils:json_reply(201, Body, Req);
    {error, Reason} ->
        mcl_api_utils:json_error(422, Reason, Req)
end.
```

**Emitter — subscribes via evoq at startup:**
```erlang
%% event_sticky_posted_v1_to_pg.erl — CORRECT
-behaviour(gen_server).

init([]) ->
    {ok, _} = reckon_evoq_adapter:subscribe(
        dev_studio_store,
        event_type,
        <<"event_sticky_posted_v1">>,
        <<"event_sticky_posted_v1_to_pg">>,
        #{subscriber_pid => self()}
    ),
    {ok, #{}}.

handle_info({events, Events}, State) ->
    lists:foreach(fun(Event) ->
        pg:send(pg, event_sticky_posted_v1, {event_sticky_posted_v1, Event})
    end, Events),
    {noreply, State}.
```

**Projection — subscribes via evoq OR listens on pg:**
```erlang
%% Direct evoq subscription (same division):
init([]) ->
    {ok, _} = reckon_evoq_adapter:subscribe(
        dev_studio_store, event_type,
        <<"event_sticky_posted_v1">>,
        <<"sticky_posted_to_event_stickies">>,
        #{subscriber_pid => self()}
    ),
    {ok, #{}}.

%% OR pg listener (inter-division):
init([]) ->
    ok = pg:join(pg, event_sticky_posted_v1, self()),
    {ok, #{}}.
```

### The Flow

```
WRONG:  API handler -> manual emit -> pg -> projection
RIGHT:  ReckonDB -> evoq subscription -> emitter -> pg -> listener
        ReckonDB -> evoq subscription -> projection (direct)
```

### Prevention

- API handlers must NEVER import or call `*_to_pg` or `*_to_mesh` modules
- Emitters must be `gen_server`s that subscribe in `init/1`
- If an emitter has an `emit/1` export (not `start_link/0`), it's wrong

### The Lesson

> **The API handler dispatches commands. The event store delivers events. These are separate concerns.**
> **Emitters subscribe to the store — they are NOT called by application code.**
> **See [EVENT_SUBSCRIPTION_FLOW.md](../../philosophy/EVENT_SUBSCRIPTION_FLOW.md) for the canonical pattern.**

## 🔥🔥🔥 Inline Projections After Command Dispatch

**Date:** 2026-03-02
**Origin:** macula-realm franchise storefront LiveViews

### The Antipattern

Writing to the read model (Repo.insert, Repo.update_all) immediately after dispatching an evoq command inside a LiveView or handler.

**Example (WRONG):**
```elixir
case :evoq_router.dispatch(cmd) do
  {:ok, _version, _events} ->
    # BAD: LiveView does the projection's job
    Repo.insert(%RealmLicense{license_id: id, status: 1, sold_at: now})
    {:noreply, put_flash(socket, :info, "License sold.")}
end
```

### Why It's Wrong

1. **Duplicates projection logic** — Same write exists in the projection AND the LiveView
2. **Bypasses the event stream** — If you replay events, the LiveView writes are lost
3. **Couples UI to persistence** — LiveViews should only dispatch commands and query read models
4. **Breaks CQRS** — The whole point is separating writes (commands → events) from reads (projections → read models)
5. **Untestable** — You can't test the projection independently if the LiveView does the write

### The Rule

> **LiveViews dispatch commands. Projections update read models. NEVER both.**
>
> After dispatch succeeds, allow the projection to process (brief sleep if needed), then reload from the read model.

### The Correct Pattern

```elixir
case :evoq_router.dispatch(cmd) do
  {:ok, _version, _events} ->
    # Projection gen_server handles the read model update
    Process.sleep(50)
    {:noreply, socket |> put_flash(:info, "License sold.") |> reload_license()}
end
```

The projection gen_server subscribes to events via `evoq_subscriptions:subscribe/5` and writes to the read model autonomously.

## 🔥🔥🔥 Consolidating PRJ and QRY Into One Department

**Date:** 2026-03-02
**Origin:** macula-realm franchise storefront architecture

### The Antipattern

Treating PRJ (projections) and QRY (queries) as one combined "QRY+PRJ" department.

### Why It's Wrong

1. **Different responsibilities** — PRJ subscribes to events and WRITES to read models. QRY READS from read models.
2. **Different lifecycles** — PRJ is event-driven (reactive). QRY is request-driven (on demand).
3. **Different scaling concerns** — PRJ throughput is event volume. QRY throughput is query volume.
4. **Violates separation of concerns** — Write path and read path must be independent.

### The Rule

> **PRJ and QRY are ALWAYS separate departments.**
>
> | Department | Nature | Direction |
> |-----------|--------|-----------|
> | **PRJ** | Event-driven | Events → Read Model (WRITE) |
> | **QRY** | Request-driven | Read Model → Response (READ) |
>
> Never combine them. Even if they share the same database tables.

### In Practice

```
Division: procure_realm_license
├── CMD: procure_realm_license (commands, aggregates, handlers)
├── PRJ: project_realm_licenses (event → PostgreSQL projections)
└── QRY: query_realm_licenses (Ecto queries on read model)
```

## 🔥🔥🔥 Separate Projections Racing on Shared ETS Table

**Date:** 2026-03-07
**Origin:** the removed daemon project_licenses, project_plugins, project_launcher

### The Antipattern

Multiple separate `evoq_projection` modules each subscribing to different event types but writing to the **same ETS table**. Each projection is a separate gen_server with its own subscription — there is NO ordering guarantee between them.

**Example (WRONG):**
```
project_licenses_sup starts:
  license_initiated_v1_to_catalog   (projection gen_server A)
  license_announced_v1_to_catalog   (projection gen_server B)
  license_published_v1_to_catalog   (projection gen_server C)
```

Each subscribes independently via `evoq_projection`. When events arrive:
1. `license_initiated_v1` — projection A creates ETS entry (INSERT)
2. `license_announced_v1` — projection B looks up entry by license_id (READ-MODIFY-WRITE)
3. `license_published_v1` — projection C looks up entry by license_id (READ-MODIFY-WRITE)

**The race:** Projections B and C can process BEFORE projection A has created the entry. `find_by_license_id/1` returns `not_found`, and the announced/published events are silently dropped. The catalog card never appears.

### Why It Happens

Each `evoq_projection` is a separate gen_server. Even though ReckonDB delivers events in order to each subscriber, **different subscribers are different processes**. The BEAM guarantees message ordering from process A to process B, but NOT ordering across multiple independent receivers.

```
ReckonDB store
  |
  ├─ delivers initiated_v1 to Projection A (gen_server pid 1)
  ├─ delivers announced_v1 to Projection B (gen_server pid 2)
  └─ delivers published_v1 to Projection C (gen_server pid 3)

Pid 2 may process its event BEFORE pid 1 processes its event.
```

### The Rule

> **One ETS table = one projection module.**
>
> If multiple event types write to the same ETS table, they MUST be handled by a SINGLE `evoq_projection` module. The single gen_server's mailbox guarantees sequential processing.

### The Correct Pattern: Merged Projection

```erlang
-module(license_lifecycle_to_catalog).
-behaviour(evoq_projection).
-export([interested_in/0, init/1, project/4]).

interested_in() ->
    [<<"license_initiated_v1">>,
     <<"license_announced_v1">>,
     <<"license_published_v1">>,
     <<"license_amended_v1">>,
     <<"license_retracted_v1">>].

init(_Config) ->
    {ok, RM} = evoq_read_model:new(evoq_read_model_ets, #{name => catalog}),
    {ok, #{}, RM}.

project(#{data := Data} = Event, _Metadata, State, RM) ->
    case get_event_type(Event) of
        <<"license_initiated_v1">>  -> project_initiated(Data, State, RM);
        <<"license_announced_v1">>  -> project_announced(Data, State, RM);
        <<"license_published_v1">>  -> project_published(Data, State, RM);
        <<"license_amended_v1">>    -> project_amended(Data, State, RM);
        <<"license_retracted_v1">>  -> project_retracted(Data, State, RM);
        _                           -> {ok, State, RM}
    end.
```

**One gen_server** processes all 5 event types sequentially. `initiated` is always processed before `announced` because the gen_server's mailbox preserves order.

### Naming Convention

Merged projections that handle multiple events for the same table are named:

```
{domain}_lifecycle_to_{table}.erl
```

Examples:
- `license_lifecycle_to_catalog.erl` — 5 license lifecycle events -> catalog ETS
- `plugin_lifecycle_to_plugins.erl` — 10 plugin lifecycle events -> plugins ETS
- `launcher_lifecycle_to_launcher.erl` — 4 launcher events -> launcher_entries + launcher_groups ETS

### When This Does NOT Apply

- **SQLite projections**: Writes go through a gen_server call to the store. The store serializes writes. Still, if projection B reads from SQLite and the row from projection A hasn't been written yet, the same race exists. Prefer merged projections for SQLite too when events are dependent.
- **Independent tables**: If each projection writes to a DIFFERENT ETS table, separate projections are fine. No shared state = no race.

### Prevention Checklist

Before adding a new projection, verify:
- [ ] Does this write to a table that OTHER projections also write to?
- [ ] Does this READ from a table that ANOTHER projection INSERTS into?
- [ ] If yes to either: MERGE into the existing lifecycle projection for that table.

### The Lesson

> **Separate gen_servers = separate timelines. If your projections share state, they must share a process.**

## 🔥 Demon 68: The Flag→Name Map That Exists Nowhere

**Date exorcised:** 2026-09-25
**Where it appeared:** `macula-services/mcl-bookclub` and its Elixir twin
`macula-services/mcl-bookclub-phoenix` — eight projections across the two
repos, written in one session each
**Cost:** Two vocabularies (the bits in CMD, the names in PRJ) coupled by
convention and nothing else; the library function that exists exactly as
the bridge between them was never read before the code that needed it was
written. The naive repair — declaring the CMD app as a PRJ dependency —
booted the mesh emitters into the projection test env and silently stalled
the $all delivery every projection depends on.

### The Lie

"Each projection writing its own readable status string IS the house rule:
computed at projection time, never at query time. The literal IS the
computation."

### What Happened

The aggregate's status module owned the raw flags — "this header is the
only place raw flags exist" — while each projection spelled the readable
name out as its own SQL literal, keyed off the event type it folds:
`'active'`, `'archived'`, `'on_shelf'`, `'retired'`, `'in_progress'`,
`'finished'`, `'unregistered'`. Nothing, anywhere, mapped a flag to its
name. `evoq_bit_flags:to_string/2` exists precisely as that bridge — a
flag map plus the conversion — and it was never read before the
projections were written; the "translation" the module comments described
was prose, not code. A rename or a new status means hunting literals
across every projection, and the one module that claims to own the flags
does not own what they mean.

The naive repair made it worse before it made it right: to read the CMD
status module from the PRJ app, host_bookclub was declared as a PRJ
*application* dependency. That boots the CMD app's mesh emitters into the
projection test env — an env with no mesh — and an emitter's
`{error, mesh_unavailable}` return stalls the router's synchronous
delivery, so the second event of a pair stopped projecting, silently,
with green dispatches and a row that never moved. The call that was
needed is a PURE function: a loaded module, not a booted app.

### The Fix

One flag map per aggregate, owned by the status module that already owns
the flags, rendered through evoq's own conversion:

```erlang
%% bookclub_status.erl -- the .hrl keeps the macros; this module owns the names
flag_map() ->
    #{?BOOKCLUB_INITIATED => <<"active">>,
      ?BOOKCLUB_ARCHIVED => <<"archived">>}.

to_string(Status) ->
    evoq_bit_flags:to_string(Status, flag_map()).
```

and each projection writes the label of the flag ITS event sets, never a
literal of its own:

```erlang
bookclub_status:to_string(bookclub_status:initiated())
```

The mechanism that refuses a relapse, on both sides:
- the status-module test pins each flag map as literals, so a name change
  is a deliberate, visible act;
- a boundary test greps the PRJ sources and refuses any QUOTED
  readable-status literal (`'active'`, `"active"`, ...) — only the quoted
  forms, because the bare words legitimately appear in event-type names
  (`book_retired_v1`) and column names (`finished_at`); a status VALUE is
  always a quoted literal. Comments count, as with the mesh-name
  boundary tests.
- the PRJ app reads the status module WITHOUT an application dependency:
  the facade's boot order covers the release, and booting the CMD app
  into a projection test env is exactly what drags the emitters in.

### The Rule

> **The bits and their names live in ONE module.** The aggregate's status
> module owns a flag map and `evoq_bit_flags:to_string/2` renders it; a
> projection that spells a readable-status literal of its own is the
> relapse, and the grep test refuses it. Read the library's own
> conversion API before you write the code that needs it — and when one
> division needs another's pure functions, depend on the module, never
> on the app.
